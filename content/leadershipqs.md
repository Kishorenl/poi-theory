7. Can you describe your experience in complete system design/architecture?
 Example: I have designed and architected below modules in Samsung Sports Excitement:
  1. User management and Gamification module, where in user gets points based on their game predictions/ sharing content/usage of the app.
  2. Push gateway to send messages to users on the latest events using GCM/SPP
  3. Websocket broker to send live scores in the app.


8. Explain current roles and responsibilities in your current job?
 - Development of new software solution (which is yet to be released in few months)
 - Use Case/Requirement discussion, Feature finalization with dates.
 - Single page web application + API design/implementation.
 - Scheduling, Deployment & Post monitoring/statistics to seniors.

9. Which project are you most proud of?
  Samsung Sports project : To engage Samsung customers with Sports excitement. We have created multiple apps under this project.
  I played pivotal role in developing an app for Soccer world cup 2014, I was the key player in design discussion/features finalization/API development/deployment and customer feedback review/metrics around app usage. This project was awarded as one of the top 5 projects for that year.


10.   Please give an example of a full cycle project you have implemented and also define what you mean by "full cycle")
  
 Ex: In current organization, I was part of one of the best teams where I had worked on POC --> getting sponsor(internal) --> Requirement Gathering/Discussion --> Design and Implementation to Deployment --> Enhancing the product features.
 Full cycle : Finding Opportunity --> economical & viable solution definition --> Design and Development --> User stats/acquisition/feedback --> Maintenance and product enhancements. (this goes in iterations)


11.   When have you mentored another engineer to develop to the next level?"
 Question intent is not quite clear to me. So, am trying to add information on "How I mentored"
 I worked in various levels (Senior Engineer/Technical Manager/Technical Lead) in  development team and I had opportunity mentor to the freshers/new employees.
  
 Our organization support mentor-mentee concept - As a mentor, I tried to keep my mentee to be challenged and out of his/her comfort zone. I used development plan (for training/progress). Some of the tools that came handy was
 - giving broader picture of the application
 - create simple POC/test applications to get more comfortable
 - Discussion & Code reviews etc
definition

12.   What has been your biggest impact in your current role?
 - Release of Samsung Sports project was my biggest achievement.
 - I was the key person for API delivery & incharge of the whole solution from HQ perspective  and I pulled it off very well with great team support. This project was complex due to 1) Teams across the globe(Brasil, US, Korea) 2) very stiff dead lines and 3) 1 M user base in the initial few days of launch.



13.   When have you influenced a customer with a software design that you created?
 While I was part of an Verizon Interactive Voice Response system, my teams objective was to improve CSAT and improve self-service in IVR. During my analysis(through some live calls/and also recorded calls, databases and logs) - I have identified few issues. After fixing those we got 5% improvement in self-serve rate.(Improvement in self-service directly more happy customers.)


14. Why are looking to leave current job?
    - I am looking for more challenging work to use my potential to the fullest and improve it.
    - I feel, I am loosing opportunity to gain knowledge from peers /external teams/seminars/trainings (as most of them are in korean and I am just a beginner).
    
15.   Tell me about your level of interest in Amazon (or) Why Amazon?
 I have been enjoying Amazon services(.com, kindle, AWS) for past decade or so. Undoubtedly its one of the best organization to work for.
 Tip-off point for me was "AWS". In my current org, we use AWS for everything possible, (when I compare it with what we used to do in physical data center model in Verizon) - AWS have took care  most of the heavy lifting from Software engineers. Its really the "AWeSome" service.
 I am a big fan of Java/open source projects, and I learnt Amazon is doing great work in this (like jquery/MQ).
 

 Kapil Kamath :  Hiring  manager (org leader)

    hire and develop - mentoring
        - senior engineer code reviews, coach, design reviews
            -> Explain business side of things  and  also sit with them to explain requirements (after the client/PO meeting)
            -> Talk  about the code and why we write it in some particular way (abstract classes/ logging)
                - This is  super important when we  work with junior  developer (coding is easy but maintainability, extensibility is what we should aim for)
            -> Take opportunity to explain the career paths
                -  Identify their interest  and help them grow
            -> Let them finish their thoughts before you tell them the "right" way
            -> Talk through the process while  designing and implementation
                - review process is most important

        Examples a senior engineer for abstract classes, Sandhya for redux/jest, intern for  following the process.
 
    ownership
        - Delivering project -  both direct and indirect
        -Samsung Sports  application - e2e ownership
            From latency tests, DDoS attacks, architecture design
        - 
        
        
    earn trust
        - how do you influence without authority
        - Expertize in  what we do in a cross functional team - API specification for a particular screen/ how to pass play  by play  to Samsung sports from Opta(like ftp/s3 etc.)
        - Share information as much as needed
        - relationships: this  helps in what we can expect  and not taken by surprise. This  helps  in earn trust and when you earn it ppl will follow you and give favours to you.
        - Attitude : be honest and straightforward.

- It can be difficult for me to maintain a healthy work/life balance
- In the past I have been uncomfortable with ambiguity
- I focus too much on the details
