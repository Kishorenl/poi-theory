Building the data pipelines that move data from where it is created to all of the different places that it is processed is a fundamental part of designing and implementing data-driven applications. Messaging is a critical technology for connecting data in this environment.

Messaging is a broad term that covers several models that differ based on how data is moved from senders to recipients. There are two primary categories of messaging models: <mark>message queuing</mark> and <mark>publish-subscribe</mark> (often referred to as pub-sub) messaging.
